# Changelog

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A MAJOR version
means `copier update` on an instance needs hands.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-07

The first release: the tag `/plinth:new-project` renders.

### Added
- The template: instances call `coolbress/plinth`'s reusable CI at a pinned commit,
  Dependabot raises the pin, `.claude/settings.json` suggests the plinth
  marketplace, allows the check commands without a prompt and denies what the
  checks cannot undo, the `non-engineer` output style ships off by default, and
  `AGENTS.md` carries the situation entrances and the review rules.
- The `owner` question (default empty): it renders pyproject's author and URLs.
  `/plinth:new-project` passes the repository's owner; empty means unknown and
  neither is rendered.
- `LICENSE` is rendered from the `license` choice, `MIT` or `Apache-2.0`, with
  the owner as the copyright holder, or "the <project> authors" when it is empty.

### Removed
- The instance session hook, `_logging.py` and the policy tests that
  `ci / floor-check` now runs; the app's tests are a smoke test and tree hygiene.
